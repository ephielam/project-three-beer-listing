#project-three-beer-listing

A three page desktop only site that dynamically fetches info on Brewdog beers via the Punk API.

The 'Find a beer' form doesn't currently do anything but it looks pretty so that's okay, right?

To do list includes:
- Write a for loop so that all hops and not just the first are pulled into the ingredients modal.
- V minor styling tweaks to get it inline with the comps. Not a deal breaker.
